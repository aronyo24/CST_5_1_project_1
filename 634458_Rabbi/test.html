    <pre>In a speech at the 90<sup>at</sup> Science Congress, internationally acknowledgedged scientist and formar Indian president Mr APJ Abdul Kalam mentioned a very importent aspect of mankinds future energy crisis. He pointed out that the era of wood and biomass has almost come to an end. The age of oil and natural gas would soon be over within the next few decades. Massive burning of worlds coal reserves may lead to a worldwide ecological disaster because coal burning emits the highest amount of carbon in the atmosphere. He pointed out that the era of wood and bio- mass has almost come to an end. The age of oil and natural gas would soon be over within the next few decades. Massive burning of world's coal reserves may lead to a worldwide ecological disaster because coal burning emits the highest amount of carbon in the atmosphere. So according to Kalam, the only solution that mankind can look to is the massive use of solar energy in future because it has some advantages over other forms of renewable energies.

        Now, why has Kalam put so much importance to the issue of energy? The energy sources have always been a major factor of change throughout history. The world's petroleum consumption has increased from 3 billion barrels annually in 1930 to 37 billion barrels annually today. In the next quarter century, the world's population is expected to be about 8 billion which is 30 percent higher than today. Developing countries will grow their economies about two times faster than industrialised countries. Global economic growth is expected to continue at 3 percent per year. Consequently, the global demand for energy will grow at about 1.7 percent per year on an average. It indicates a 50-percent rise of energy consumption by 2030. If the world's daily petroleum consumption is 100 million barrels now, it will rise to 150 million barrels by that time. The present reserve of hydro-carbon energy resources is limited and it will not be sufficient to meet the future energy challenges of the world. Hence, leading 
        
        gfindustrial countries have taken initiatives to use alternative energy sources mainly known as green or renewable energy sources. The bottom line of Kalam's speech indicates the concern of mankind in the 21st century. </pre>

        <pre>Countries of the world rely heavily on petroleum, coal and natural gas for their energy
            sources. There are two major types of energy sources: renewable and non-renewable. Hydrocarbon or fossil fuels are non-renewable sources of energy. Reliance on them poses real big
            problems. First, fossil fuels such as oil, coal, gas etc. are finite energy resources and the
            world eventually will run out of them. Secondly, they will become too expensive in the
            coming decades and too damaging for the environment to repair. Thirdly, fossil fuels have
            direct polluting impacts on earth’s environment causing global warming. In contrast,
            renewable energy sources such as wind and solar energy are constantly and naturally
            replenished and never run out.
            Most renewable energy comes either directly or indirectly from the sun. Sunlight or solar
            energy can be used for heating and lighting homes, for generating electricity and for other
            commercial and industrial uses.
            The sun’s heat drives the wind and this wind energy can be captured with wind turbines to
            produce electricity. Then the wind and the sun’s heat cause water to evaporate. When this
            water vapor turns into rain or snow and flows downhill into rivers or streams, its energy can
            be captured as hydroelectric energy.
            Along with the rain and snow, sunlight causes plants to grow. Plants produce biomass which
            again can be turned into fuels such as firewood, alcohol etc identified as bio-energy.
            Scientists have identified Hydrogen as another form of renewable energy source. It is the
            most abundantelement in nature. But it does not exist separately as a gas. It is always
            combined with other elements, such as with oxygen to make water. Hydrogen, separated from
            another element can be burnt as a fuel to produce electricity.
            Our earth’s interior contains molten lava with tremendous heat. This heat inside the earth
            produces steam and hot water which can be tapped as geothermal energy to produce
            electricity, for heating home etc.
            Ocean energy comes from several sources. Ocean’s force of tide and wave can be used to
            produce energy. The surface of the ocean gets more heat from the sun than the ocean depths.
            This temperature difference can be used as energy source too.
